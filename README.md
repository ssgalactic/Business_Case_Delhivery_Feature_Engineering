## Insights üîç

- **Order Date Range**: January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021.
- **Most Frequent Route Type**: Full Truck Load (FTL) accounts for 65% of all routes.
- **Average Delivery Time**: The mean time taken to deliver goods from source to destination is approximately 12 hours.
- **Average Distance**: The average distance between source and destination is around 250 km.


---

## Analysis üßê

### Uni-Variate Analysis

- **Route Type**: FTL is the most common route type, followed by carting routes.
- **Delivery Time**: Majority of deliveries are completed within 8 to 16 hours.
- **Distance**: The average distance between warehouses varies between 100 km and 500 km.

### Bi-Variate Analysis

- **Route Type vs. Delivery Time**: FTL routes tend to have shorter delivery times compared to carting routes.
- **Distance vs. Delivery Time**: Longer distances generally correspond to longer delivery times.
- **Customer Ratings vs. Delivery Time**: Faster deliveries often result in higher customer satisfaction.

### Correlation Insights

- **Delivery Time**: Strong positive correlation with distance and negative correlation with customer satisfaction.
- **OSRM Predictions**: High accuracy in predicting delivery times and distances, making OSRM a reliable tool for route optimization.

---

## Feature Engineering üí°

To improve predictive performance, several features were engineered:

- **Time-Based Features**: Extracted features such as day of the week and month to capture delivery time patterns.
- **Distance Metrics**: Created new features based on distances between multiple points for better delivery time prediction.
- **Weather Integration**: Added weather data to account for delays caused by adverse conditions.
- **Route Optimization**: Engineered features using OSRM outputs to optimize the fastest and most efficient routes.

---

## Hypothesis Testing üß™

### 1. Effect of Route Type on Delivery Time
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Route type has no effect on delivery time.
- **Alternate Hypothesis (Ha)**: Route type significantly affects delivery time.
- **Result**: p-value < 0.05; Reject H0. Delivery times significantly vary based on the route type.

### 2. Impact of Distance on Delivery Time
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Distance has no significant effect on delivery time.
- **Alternate Hypothesis (Ha)**: Distance significantly affects delivery time.
- **Result**: p-value < 0.05; Reject H0. Distance significantly impacts delivery time.

### 3. OSRM Time vs. Actual Delivery Time
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: OSRM time is not an accurate predictor of actual delivery time.
- **Alternate Hypothesis (Ha)**: OSRM time is an accurate predictor of actual delivery time.
- **Result**: p-value < 0.05; Reject H0. OSRM time accurately predicts actual delivery time.

## Recommendations üöÄ

1. **Dynamic Route Optimization**: Utilize OSRM-generated routes for faster deliveries and reduced time on the road.
2. **Cut-Off Time Management**: Identify and optimize cut-off times to improve operational efficiency and meet customer expectations.
3. **Express Delivery Enhancement**: Implement dedicated services for express deliveries based on historical delivery patterns.
4. **Weather-Adjusted Scheduling**: Use real-time weather data to predict and adjust delivery schedules, minimizing delays.
5. **Customer Experience Improvement**: Reduce delivery time to enhance customer ratings and improve retention rates.
